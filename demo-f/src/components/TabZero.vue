            <p>
              <b>SenSE</b> is a tool that facilitates the analysis and
              exploration of Semantic Shift (also called Language Change or
              Semantic Change).
            </p>
            <p>
              Semantic shift is the process through which words in a given
              language are subject to changes in meaning. Such changes may
              consist of a word acquiring a new sense, driven by cultural
              transformations. The acquisition of a new sense by a word may be
              followed by a total loss of its original sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>For example</b>, the word <mark>awful</mark> in English in the
              year 1800 was used to describe something <em>impressive</em> (full
              of awe). Eventually, <mark>awful</mark> a synonym for something
              unpleasant and it is no longer used in its original sense.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Another example</b> is that of the word
              <mark>plane</mark> which before the invention of the aircraft
              related to a surface and in the 21st century it acquired new
              meaning despite still being used to designate a surface.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this demonstration, you will be able to explore semantic shift
              in datasets from different time periods, cultures, communities,
              and languages. You will be able to inspect words that are
              semantically shifted, exploring difference in contexts, similar
              words, and sentence examples that are semantically distinct from
              each other.
